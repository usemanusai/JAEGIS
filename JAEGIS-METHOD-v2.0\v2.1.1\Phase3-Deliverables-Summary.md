- Cross-squad coordination protocols
- GitHub integration points
- Dynamic resource fetching compatibility
- Comprehensive validation frameworks

### 3. Squad Commands Reference
**File**: `squad-commands.md`

**Command Categories**:
- **Master Orchestration Commands**: System-wide control and analytics
- **Mode Selection Commands**: Enhanced mode switching capabilities
- **Squad Management Commands**: Squad activation, status, optimization
- **Tier-Specific Commands**: Commands for each tier and squad
- **Cross-Squad Coordination**: Multi-squad operations and workflows
- **GitHub Integration Commands**: Resource management and dynamic loading
- **Emergency & Maintenance**: System recovery and diagnostic commands

**Total Commands**: 100+ specialized commands for comprehensive system control

## Architecture Enhancements

### Backward Compatibility Maintained
- Original 24-agent system preserved as "Standard Development Mode"
- Existing GitHub resource paths maintained

### GitHub Integration Strategy
- **Dual Configuration Approach**:
  - `core/agent-config.txt` - Original 24-agent system
  - `core/enhanced-agent-config.txt` - New 68-agent system
- **Enhanced Resource Loading**:
  - `commands/squad-commands.md` - Enhanced command set
  - Squad-specific templates and validation frameworks
- **Dynamic Resource Fetching**:
  - Mode-based resource loading
  - Squad-specific resource triggers
  - Intelligent fallback mechanisms

## Quality Standards Implemented
