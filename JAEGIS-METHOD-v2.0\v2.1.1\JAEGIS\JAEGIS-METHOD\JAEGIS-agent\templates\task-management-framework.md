# Task Management Framework Template
## Comprehensive Task Orchestration & Workflow Management System

### Framework Overview
This template provides a standardized framework for task management across the JAEGIS system, ensuring consistent task creation, monitoring, coordination, validation, and optimization processes that support efficient project execution and continuous improvement.

### Core Framework Components
