# P.I.T.C.E.S. Framework - Redis Vector Integration Enhancement

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Redis vector integration enhancement for the P.I.T.C.E.S. (Parallel Integrated Task Contexting Engine System) framework, providing advanced caching strategies, vector-based decision making, and real-time task management capabilities.

## Enhanced Components

### 1. Redis Vector Engine (`pitces/core/redis_vector_engine.py`)

- Vector similarity search for workflow decisions, task contexts, and gap analysis
- Multi-dimensional vector storage with configurable dimensions
- Cosine similarity matching with adjustable thresholds
- Real-time indexing and search capabilities
- Performance metrics and monitoring

**Key Capabilities:**
- Store and retrieve workflow decision vectors
- Find similar task contexts using vector similarity
